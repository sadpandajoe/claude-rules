# Archive Entry Template

Append this block to PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md. Preserve any earlier entries above; do not rewrite history.

## Archive: [Phase Name] — [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Summary
- **Timeline**: [Start] to [End]
- **Goal**: [What we tried to accomplish]
- **Outcome**: [What actually happened]
- **Key Commits**: [sha1, sha2]

### Key Decisions
- [Decision 1 and why]
- [Decision 2 and why]

### Full Details

[Paste archived sections here verbatim]
```

## Rules

- Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format for sort/grep friendliness.
- Summary fields are short — one line each. Detail goes in "Full Details".
- "Key Decisions" should capture *why*, not just *what*. Future readers care about the reasoning.
- Preserve archived sections verbatim under "Full Details" — don't paraphrase, don't trim.
