description: Archive completed-phase content from PROJECT.md to PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md, and delete stale PLAN.md when no active workflow uses it. Use when PROJECT.md is cluttered with completed work or before starting a new major phase.

# /archive-project-file

> **When**: A project/feature is done and needs to be preserved.
> **Produces**: Archived PROJECT.md content in PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md, stale PLAN.md deleted.

This command should be owned by one main agent. Do not split the write across multiple agents — the archive boundary, breadcrumb, and preserved active context must stay consistent.

## Contract

### Goal
Keep PROJECT.md focused on active work by moving completed-phase detail into PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md. When a stale PLAN.md exists with no active workflow, delete it.

### In Scope
- completed investigations, implementations, milestones, and resolved blockers
- older log sections that are no longer needed for active execution
- leaving a short summary and reference behind in PROJECT.md
- deleting a stale PLAN.md (no active workflow uses it)

### Out of Scope
- active work
- current status
- current continuation checkpoint
- anything still needed for the next immediate phase
- the PLAN.md of an active workflow — those are deleted by the workflow's completion step, not here

## When to Archive

**Good times:**
- After a major phase is complete and no longer active
- After feature implementation is merged and follow-up work is minimal
- After major refactoring finishes
- When PROJECT.md becomes hard to navigate
- Before starting a new major phase

**Don't archive yet if:**
- Work still in progress
- Solution not validated
- Tests still failing
- Under active review
- The archived material is still needed for the next immediate phase

## Steps

### 1. Identify what to archive

Infer the best archive candidate from PROJECT.md first. Common candidates: completed investigation, implemented feature, finished refactoring, closed milestone.

Only ask the user if multiple candidates are equally plausible or the boundary is unclear. If there's one clear completed phase, proceed automatically.

### 2. Read current PROJECT.md

Use the `Read` tool to view PROJECT.md contents.

### 3. Determine sections to archive

| Archive | Keep |
|---|---|
| Completed investigation timelines | Current Status |
| Failed Solutions (once solution working) | Active / In Progress work |
| Old Development Log entries | Recent Development Log (last few entries) |
| Resolved blockers | Open blockers |
| Completed implementation notes | Next steps |
| | Current continuation checkpoint |
| | Anything needed for the next immediate phase |

### 4. Create archive entry

Use the template at [templates/archive-entry.md](templates/archive-entry.md). Append to PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md (don't rewrite prior archive entries).

### 5. Update PROJECT.md

Replace archived sections with the breadcrumb template at [templates/project-md-after.md](templates/project-md-after.md). Keep only:
- phase name and completion date
- 1–3 sentence summary
- pointer to PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md

### 6. Log the archiving

Append a Development Log entry using [templates/log-entry.md](templates/log-entry.md).

### 7. Handle stale PLAN.md (if applicable)

If a `PLAN.md` exists at the repo root AND no active workflow references it (no Continuation Checkpoint with `Active plan: PLAN.md`):
- Delete it
- Append a "Completed" entry to PROJECT.md if not already present: `<date> — <feature>`

The audit trail of what was built lives in git (commits, PR description). Don't preserve PLAN.md content — it was a working draft, not a record.

If a Continuation Checkpoint references PLAN.md, leave it in place and surface to the user — they may have an unfinished workflow.

### 8. Verify

- [ ] Archive entry written to PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md
- [ ] Critical info preserved
- [ ] PROJECT.md more concise
- [ ] References resolve
- [ ] Stale PLAN.md handled (deleted or left for active workflow)

For a worked before/after, see [examples/worked-example.md](examples/worked-example.md).

## Notes
- Archive completed phases, don't delete the content
- Keep PROJECT.md focused on current work
- Searchable history lives in PROJECT_ARCHIVE.md
- Use when completed phases are cluttering active work, not as a substitute for checkpointing
- Once invoked, auto-archive the clear candidate rather than pausing for routine confirmation
- Ask only when the archive boundary is genuinely ambiguous
