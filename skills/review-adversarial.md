# Adversarial Code Review

Review changed code with the assumption that it is broken. Your job is to prove it — find the specific input, sequence, or condition that causes failure.

## Focus Areas

### Security
- Injection: SQL, command, template, XSS, SSRF
- Auth/authz: bypass paths, privilege escalation, missing permission checks
- Secrets: hardcoded tokens, keys, passwords, connection strings in code or config
- Deserialization: untrusted data parsed without validation

### Edge Cases
- Null, undefined, empty string, empty collection, zero, negative values
- Boundary values: max int, max length, Unicode, special characters
- Single-item vs. multi-item vs. no-item collections
- Time zones, daylight saving, leap years, epoch boundaries

### Race Conditions
- Concurrent access to shared state (files, databases, caches)
- Async ordering: setState before/after await, callback ordering
- TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) bugs
- Lock contention, deadlock potential

### Error Handling
- Uncaught exceptions in async code
- Error swallowing (empty catch blocks, ignored return values)
- Missing fallbacks for external service failures
- Partial failure in batch operations

### Data Integrity
- Partial writes without transactions
- Inconsistent state after failed operations
- Missing rollback or cleanup on error paths
- Stale cache reads after writes

### Input Validation
- Untrusted input at system boundaries (API endpoints, form fields, URL params)
- Missing sanitization before database queries or shell commands
- Type coercion surprises (string "0" vs number 0, "null" vs null)
- File path traversal, symlink attacks

## Output Format

For each finding, construct a specific failure scenario:

```markdown
### [vulnerability|edge-case|race-condition|missing-validation] — {title}

**File:** {path}:{line}
**Scenario:** {Specific input, sequence, or condition that triggers the failure}
**Impact:** {What breaks — data loss, auth bypass, crash, incorrect result}
**Fix:** {Specific change to prevent the failure}
```

## Scoring

Rate the overall adversarial assessment:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Hardened** (9-10) | No exploitable findings. Edge cases handled. Defensive coding throughout. |
| **Adequate** (6-8) | Minor gaps but no critical vulnerabilities. Some edge cases unhandled. |
| **Vulnerable** (3-5) | One or more exploitable issues. Missing validation at boundaries. |
| **Critical** (1-2) | Security vulnerabilities or data integrity risks that must be fixed before merge. |

## Rules

- Do not flag theoretical issues — every finding must have a concrete scenario
- Do not flag style or readability — this is not a code quality review
- Do not flag missing features — only flag missing protection for existing features
- Focus on what the changed code does, not what it doesn't do
- If you find nothing, say so — "No adversarial findings" is a valid and valuable result
