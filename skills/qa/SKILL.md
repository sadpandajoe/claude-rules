name: qa
description: Use when triaging a bug report, validating that a fix actually resolved the user-visible problem, assessing the impact of a code change, discovering use cases for a feature, expanding regression scenarios, executing a manual test plan against a real environment, or filing a clean bug report. Trigger phrases include "triage", "validate the fix", "what should we test", "smoke test", "use cases", "regression scenarios", "file a bug". Do NOT use for writing automated test code (use testing/), reviewing test code quality, technical plan review, or code-quality review.

# QA

## Before Starting

Read any sibling `rules.md`, `lessons.md`, and `gotchas.md` files if present.

Umbrella skill for repo-standard QA phases. The orchestrator picks the relevant phase from the decision tree below and reads the corresponding reference for steps + output template.

## Phases

| Phase | When | Reference |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Bug triage | Pre-investigation: turn loose report into repro plan | [references/triage-bug.md](references/triage-bug.md) |
| Validate fix | Post-implementation: confirm bug resolved in user-visible flow | [references/validate-fix.md](references/validate-fix.md) |
| Impact assessment | Code review: classify changeset as CORE / STANDARD / PERIPHERAL | [references/assess-impact.md](references/assess-impact.md) |
| Analyze use cases | Discovery: build use-case matrix from code + context | [references/analyze-use-cases.md](references/analyze-use-cases.md) |
| Expand scenarios | After fix is known: identify smallest extra checks for regression protection | [references/expand-scenarios.md](references/expand-scenarios.md) |
| Execute use cases | Run scenarios against a real environment with evidence capture | [references/execute-use-cases.md](references/execute-use-cases.md) |
| File bug | Strong failure signal needs a clean handoff (Shortcut posting included) | [references/file-bug.md](references/file-bug.md) |

## Invocation Patterns

Most QA phases are checklist + output-template work the orchestrator does inline:

1. Read the relevant reference.
2. Follow its steps.
3. Emit its output block into the conversation.

When fresh context matters (long-running session, parallel work, separation from the implementation thread), spawn a `general-purpose` subagent and pass the reference content as the prompt. Each reference declares its recommended model in frontmatter.

## Phase Composition

Common combinations:
- **Bug workflow** (`/fix-bug`): triage-bug → (implement) → validate-fix → optionally file-bug
- **Code review** (`/review-code`, `/review-pr`): assess-impact (always) → expand-scenarios (when reviewing a fix)
- **Test plan**: analyze-use-cases → expand-scenarios → execute-use-cases
- **PR smoke test** (`/test-pr`): assess-impact → [references/pr-smoke-scenarios.md](references/pr-smoke-scenarios.md) → execute-use-cases

## Notes

- References hold the per-phase steps and output templates. SKILL.md only routes.
- Environment prep lives in the `preflight` skill (`preflight/references/prepare-environment.md`) — used outside QA contexts too (implementation env prep). Triage and validate-fix link to it when env prep is required.
- `file-bug` includes the Shortcut posting protocol for workflows that push results back.
