# Investigate Change

Use this phase when a workflow needs investigation or root-cause analysis as an internal step rather than as a standalone user-facing command.

## Goal

Understand what is broken, identify the most plausible root cause with evidence, and hand the result back to the calling workflow.

## Scope

Use this for:

- code-level behavior investigation
- local root-cause analysis
- validating whether a suspected fix already exists
- narrowing failure scope before planning or adaptation

This file is the reusable RCA phase for larger workflows. Use it when the public action is still `/fix-bug`, `/create-feature`, or another end-to-end command.

## Core Steps

1. Define the problem precisely.
2. Reproduce if possible.
3. Inspect code, history, and recent changes. Scope git searches to master and the current branch — do not use `git log --all` (unmerged branches may contain experimental or unvetted code).
4. Identify the most likely introducing change. When restoring removed or commented-out code, trace the removal commit on master and inspect its parent (`git show <sha>^:<file>`) rather than searching other branches.
5. Check whether an equivalent fix already exists.
6. Summarize root cause, evidence, and open uncertainty.

## Output

Return a compact handoff:

```markdown
## Investigation Summary

- Problem: <what is broken>
- Root cause: <most likely cause>
- Evidence: <key proof points>
- Existing fix: <yes/no and where>
- Open questions: <remaining uncertainty>
```

## When Investigating a Bug

A bug investigation is the same process as above, with three extra expectations for how you frame the work:

1. **Restate the reported problem in code-level terms** — trace from the user-visible symptom to the code path responsible.
2. **Attempt local reproduction when practical** — if reproduction is not possible, explain why and what indirect evidence substitutes.
3. **Frame findings in terms of user impact** — connect the root cause back to the observable failure the user reported.

And extend the output with these fields:

- **Affected area**: files, services, or flows involved
- **Introducing change**: commit or PR that introduced the regression, or "unknown"
- **Existing local safeguards**: tests, guards, or defensive checks that should have caught this (present / absent / partial)

Full extended output:

```markdown
## Bug Investigation

- Problem: <user-visible symptom, in code-level terms>
- Affected area: <files, services, flows>
- Likely root cause: <most plausible cause>
- Evidence: <key proof points>
- Introducing change: <commit / PR / unknown>
- Existing local safeguards: <present / absent / partial>
- Existing fix: <yes/no and where>
- Open questions: <remaining uncertainty>
```
