# Classify CI Failure

Use this phase after CI logs or artifacts have been gathered.

## Goal

Identify the failing step, match it to a known pattern when possible, and produce a root-cause hypothesis plus a narrow proposed fix.

## Known Failure Patterns

| Pattern | Symptoms | Fix | Confidence |
|---------|----------|-----|------------|
| **Stale TypeScript declarations** | `TS2305: Module has no exported member` after rename/move | Rebuild: `npm run build` or delete `dist/` and rebuild | HIGH |
| **Missing dependencies** | `Cannot find module 'X'` in CI but works locally | Add to `package.json` / `requirements.txt`, run install | HIGH |
| **Import path case mismatch** | Works on macOS (case-insensitive), fails on Linux CI | Fix the import path casing to match the actual filename | HIGH |
| **Lint/format drift** | `eslint` or `prettier` failures on lines you didn't change | Run formatter (`npm run lint:fix`, `ruff format`), commit | HIGH |
| **Flaky test — timing** | Test passes locally, fails in CI with timeout | Increase timeout or add `waitFor`/retry logic | MEDIUM |
| **Flaky test — order-dependent** | Test fails only when run with full suite, passes alone | Find shared state (global, DB, env var), isolate it | MEDIUM |
| **Cherry-pick residue** | Conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`) in committed files | Search and resolve remaining markers | HIGH |
| **Missing env vars** | `undefined` or `KeyError` for config values | Add to CI config (`.github/workflows/`, `.env.ci`) | MEDIUM |
| **Node version mismatch** | Syntax errors or API differences | Check `.nvmrc` / `engines` field vs CI node version | MEDIUM |
| **Out-of-memory** | `FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed` | Reduce `maxWorkers`, add `--max-old-space-size` | HIGH |
| **Lock file conflict** | `npm ci` fails with lockfile mismatch | Regenerate lockfile: `npm install`, commit `package-lock.json` | HIGH |
| **Pre-existing / not-our-failure** | Failing file/test is not in our diff; same failure exists on the base branch | N/A — not caused by this branch | HIGH |

## Analysis Steps

1. Read the full error output, not just the first line.
2. Identify the actual failing step: build, test, lint, install, or workflow/config.
3. Split multi-job failures into separate failure units and de-duplicate repeated stack traces.
4. Match each failure against the known patterns above.
5. **Ownership check**: For each failure, determine whether this branch caused it:
   - Is the failing file or test touched by our diff? (`git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD`)
   - Does the same failure exist on the base branch? (`gh run list --branch <base> --status failure --limit 3`)
   - If the answer is "not in our diff" AND "fails on base too", classify as **Pre-existing / not-our-failure**.
6. If no pattern matches, read the referenced files and recent commits before classifying it as novel.

Use numeric confidence with these defaults:
- `8-10` = `HIGH`
- `5-7` = `MEDIUM`
- `1-4` = `LOW`

## Output Format

For each failure, end with this block:

```markdown
### Failure: [step name]

**Error**: [key error message]
**Pattern**: [matched pattern name, or "Novel"]
**Confidence**: X/10 (`HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW`)
**Root Cause**: [explanation]
**Proposed Fix**: [specific fix with commands/code changes]
**Verification**: [how to verify the fix locally]
```

For **Pre-existing / not-our-failure** classifications, set `Proposed Fix: N/A` and `Verification: N/A`. The calling workflow handles the early-exit path.

Use `action-gate.md` after producing this output to decide whether to proceed automatically. The calling workflow may also use this output for a complexity gate evaluation.
