# PR Review Procedure

Use for a single GitHub PR review after `/review-pr` resolves the PR reference.

## Gather Context

Fetch:

```bash
gh pr view <ref> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,files,additions,deletions
gh pr diff <ref>
gh pr view <ref> --json files -q '.files[].path'
```

Read full contents of changed files. Review comments target changed lines, but the review must understand surrounding context.

## Complexity Gate

Classify the PR scope with the shared TRIVIAL / MODERATE / STANDARD gate and this review-specific routing:

| Signal | Trivial | Moderate | Standard |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| Files changed | 1-3 | 4-8 in one subsystem | 9+ or unclear ownership |
| Lines changed | < 100 | 100-400 | 400+ |
| Behavioral change | None / cosmetic | Contained functional change | Cross-cutting or contract change |
| Reviewer lanes | Code quality only | Triggered lanes only | Full triggered team, plus optional second opinion |

Emit the Complexity Gate block per `rules/complexity-gate.md`.

Trivial + confidence 8/10+: code quality review only, unless impact assessment escalates. Moderate: triggered reviewer lanes only, with no premise deep-dive unless impact or uncertainty escalates. Standard: premise validation plus full triggered team.

## Assess Impact and Premise

Run [../../qa/references/assess-impact.md](../../qa/references/assess-impact.md) on the PR diff to classify impact as CORE, STANDARD, or PERIPHERAL.

Impact escalation:
- TRIVIAL + CORE -> full review team
- MODERATE + CORE -> triggered reviewer lanes plus stricter severity calibration
- STANDARD + CORE -> full team + suggest adversarial review for security-sensitive areas

For Standard, CORE-impact, or low-confidence PRs, validate the premise before reviewing implementation details:
1. Read linked issue/ticket, PR description, author comments, and prior reviewer comments.
2. Investigate whether the stated problem exists.
3. For bug fixes, check whether the fix addresses the actual cause.
4. For features, check whether the feature solves the stated need and belongs in the chosen architecture.

If the premise is wrong, make that the primary finding and skip remaining review lanes. Still route it through the reasoning/confirmation flow before posting.

## Detect Review Team

Follow [classify-diff.md](classify-diff.md) with the diff and complexity tier. Pass the impact assessment to all reviewers so severity calibration can account for CORE workflows.

For Standard or CORE-escalated PRs, include pattern analysis:
- read 2-3 similar files in the same directory/module
- compare naming, error handling, imports, signatures, and local conventions
- flag convention deviations as `[minor]` with evidence

## Launch Review Lanes

Trivial:
- Single-pass code quality review.
- If clean, return a compact approve recommendation. Post/approve only when `--auto` or explicit user authorization grants that boundary.

Moderate:
- Launch only the triggered reviewer lenses needed by the diff classification.
- Keep the main thread compact: collect findings, recommendation, confidence, and any premise uncertainty.
- Escalate to Standard only when reviewers find cross-cutting risk, unclear ownership, or security-sensitive behavior.

Standard:
- Launch triggered reviewer lenses in parallel.
- Use reasoning-effort selection from `rules/orchestration.md`; default to standard effort for bounded PRs, heavier effort for substantial multi-system or security-sensitive reviews.
- Optional second opinion when available.
- Adversarial lane only with `--adversarial` or security-sensitive detection.

## Synthesize and Score

Merge findings, deduplicate, and score:

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Root Cause | Why was this change needed? |
| Solution | Is it efficient, maintainable, and scoped? |
| Tests | Are tests realistic and meaningful? |
| Code | Is it readable, consistent, and correct? |
| Docs | Are docs/comments sufficient? |

Use `rules/code-review.md` and `rules/severity.md`.

Before posting findings, show the user:
- issue and proposed severity
- why this severity
- confidence
- evidence

Clean reviews skip the reasoning review and proceed to posting rules.

## Recommendation

- **Approve**: overall 8/10+, zero `[major]`
- **Request Changes**: any `[major]`, or overall below 6/10
- **Comment**: overall 6-7/10, no `[major]` but notable `[minor]`

## Output

Return the synthesized review plus:
- recommendation
- team selected
- component scores
- finding counts
- posting mode needed (`draft`, `confirm`, `auto`)
