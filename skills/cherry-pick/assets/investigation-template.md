# Investigation Output Template

## Rules

- The **"Raw Signals for Gate"** block is not optional — the gate consumes it.
- Prefer a summary line ("12 files apply cleanly, 2 need adaptation, 1 doesn't exist on target") over a 12-row table with "OK" repeated.
- Omit sections that don't apply. Write "N/A" once rather than filling a table with "none."
- Report what investigation **observed**. Do not make the go/no-go call — that is the gate's job.
