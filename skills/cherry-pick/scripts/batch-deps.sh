# batch-deps.sh — file-overlap analysis for cherry-pick batches.
#
# Given a list of source SHAs (must be reachable in the local git repo), emits
# the mechanical signals needed to build a real dependency-aware execution order:
#
#   1. Per-SHA file lists (author-date order, oldest first)
#   2. SHA pairs that share files (dependency edges; the earlier one should
#      generally come first, but verify by inspecting hunks for revert/replace)
#   3. Per-file SHA coverage (files touched by 2+ SHAs are dependency points;
#      files touched by 1 SHA are independent)
#   4. Author-date execution order (a valid topological sort iff no later
#      commit reverts or replaces content from an earlier one — verify this)
#
# This is mechanical. The LLM reads the output and decides:
#   - parallel-investigation islands (zero shared files with all others)
#   - whether author-date order is actually safe or needs a swap
#   - which SHA pairs warrant the most careful conflict resolution
#
# Usage: batch-deps.sh <sha1> <sha2> [<sha3> ...]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = analysis complete
#   2 = invocation error or invalid SHA
