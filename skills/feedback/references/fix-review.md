# Fix + Review PR Feedback

## Fix Order

Address approved fixes in this order:

1. Bugs and security issues.
2. Missing error handling or data integrity checks.
3. Project standards and mechanical cleanup.

Use TDD for behavioral changes when feasible: write the failing test first, then fix it. Cosmetic or pattern-following edits may be fixed directly when existing coverage is enough.

## Large Review Rounds

When approved fixes are independent, keep the main thread as the orchestrator:

- Group comments by file, subsystem, or originating commit.
- Batch 2-4 small groups per wave; use single-item waves for risky behavior changes.
- Give subagents only the relevant comments, files, diff context, and expected validation.
- Require a compact handoff: comments addressed, changed files, tests run, reply draft, residual risk.

The main thread owns final review, posting, thread resolution, and user-facing summary.

## Review Gate

Run `/review-code` on changed files after substantive fixes. The developer emits the Review Gate block from `rules/review-gate.md`.

For truly minimal edits, such as typo fixes or mechanical renames, review may be skipped under the review-gate skip rule. State the skip reason.

## Commit Strategy

Prefer fixing the originating in-PR commit when the branch is not merged and the source commit is clear.

This section recommends a git shape only. Do not commit, amend, rebase, push, or force-push unless the user explicitly authorized that exact boundary for this feedback round. `--auto` may skip triage or posting confirmations, but it does not authorize git history mutation by itself.

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Fix corrects one prior in-PR commit | `git commit --fixup=<originating-sha>` then autosquash rebase |
| Fix spans multiple originating commits | Fix up earliest affected commit, or ask user |
| Fix is additive beyond original scope | New commit |
| Branch is shared or active re-review is underway | New commit; avoid rewriting history |

Autosquash mechanics:

```bash
git commit --fixup=<originating-sha>
git rebase --autosquash <base>
git push --force-with-lease
```

Force-push only after explicit user authorization, only on the current feature branch, and only with `--force-with-lease`. Never force-push main/master or a protected branch.

## Persist Fix Wave to PROJECT.md (Hard Gate Before Clear)

After each fix wave, before `/checkpoint --clear` can fire, the orchestrator must append a `## Feedback Round N` entry to PROJECT.md:

```markdown
## Feedback Round N
Wave: [comment ids addressed]
Files changed: [list]
Tests: [added/updated/none]
Verification: [STRONG/PARTIAL/WEAK + result]
Review Gate: [status]
Residual risk: [...]
Next: [next wave / posting / done]
```

This block is what `/start` reads to resume mid-feedback-round after a clear. Without it, the comment-id → fix-state mapping is lost.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before push/post when:

- `--draft` was passed.
- A `Discuss` verdict needs the user's wording or decision.
- Push would require unsafe history rewriting.
- Verification failed or could not run and the change is substantive.
