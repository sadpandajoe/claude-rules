# Resource Management Principles

## Golden Rules
- [ ] **Check resources before consuming them** — Docker, test workers, builds
- [ ] **One stack at a time** — shut down before starting another
- [ ] **Scale workers to available resources** — not to CPU count

## Routing

Use this file as the always-on index. Load the scoped rule only when the task needs it:

| Work | Read |
|------|------|
| Starting Docker or local app stacks | `skills/preflight/rules.md` |
| Entering or preparing a git worktree | `skills/preflight/rules.md` |
| Running Jest, pytest, Playwright, or similar suites | `skills/testing/rules.md` |

## Always-On Guardrails

- Before starting containers, run `docker ps` and check **two things**:
  1. **How many** are running — if more than two, show them and ask before starting another stack.
  2. **Which look stale** — surface any container running > 24h (column: `STATUS`) or whose name references an old branch/feature, list them with age, and ask the user whether to stop them. Do not stop without confirmation.
- Before heavy test runs, choose worker counts intentionally; do not blindly use CPU count.
- In worktrees, assume dependencies, build outputs, and env files may be missing until checked.

## Host Capacity Reference

Current host: Apple M5 Pro, 15 cores, 48 GB RAM. Docker Desktop's memory cap is set independently of host RAM — check `docker info | grep "Total Memory"` to see it. The daemon ceiling is the binding constraint for "how many stacks can I run", not host RAM. A Superset stack uses 4–6 GB; with the cap at 7.75 GiB you can realistically run one heavy stack plus light services. With the cap at 16–24 GB you can run two to three concurrent stacks.

If the user is hitting capacity limits, suggest raising Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory rather than killing work. Do not change Docker Desktop settings programmatically.

Detailed stack, worktree, and worker-count rules are skill-scoped so they only load for environment prep or testing work.
