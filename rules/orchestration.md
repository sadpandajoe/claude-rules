# Orchestration Principles

## Primary Orchestrator Model

The active coding agent is the primary orchestrator: planning, investigation, complex reasoning, verification, durable state, and final synthesis. Secondary tools, CLIs, models, or subagents are optional delegatees for bounded, well-specified tasks when available.

| Role | Owner | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Orchestrator** | Active coding agent | Planning, architecture, RCA, multi-file refactors, security-sensitive code |
| **Delegatee** (optional) | Secondary tool/model/CLI | Single-file implementations, boilerplate, mechanical transforms, test generation from spec |
| **Internal workers** | Subagents/workers | Exploration, planning, research |
| **Domain reviewers** | Skill subagents | Architecture, implementation, testing, frontend, backend perspectives |

## Reasoning Load And Effort

Match subagent resources to the **actual reasoning load of this specific task**, not the category label. A trivial architecture review uses a standard reviewer; a gnarly multi-constraint planning task uses heavy reasoning regardless of role label.

| Reasoning load | Effort boundary | Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Mechanical — no judgment, just retrieval or pattern-match | low | File search, symbol grep, listing definitions, fetching a known artifact |
| Standard — apply known patterns, classify, review bounded change, single-file work | medium / high | Triage, RCA validation, single-file implementation, log classification, reviews where the diff or plan is small/well-scoped |
| Heavy — multi-constraint trade-offs, novel design, deep adversarial probing across many files | high / xhigh | Cross-system plans, real architectural trade-offs, security-sensitive adversarial review, hard fix planning where the failure surface is unclear |

**The decision rule**: assess the *substance* of this specific task before choosing. Default to standard reasoning. Drop to mechanical only for purely mechanical work. Escalate to heavy only when this specific instance genuinely requires deep reasoning. Role labels do not auto-promote the task — the actual scope does.

Provider mapping is runtime-specific. Keep reusable rules in neutral mechanical/standard/heavy terms, then translate to the platform's available model or reasoning-effort controls at invocation time.

**Cherry-pick reasoning tiering**: Cherry-pick phases use gate-driven reasoning selection rather than the general reasoning-load heuristic above. The gate classifies difficulty (TRIVIAL vs NON-TRIVIAL) and that classification determines worker effort for plan, validate, and adapt phases. See `skills/cherry-pick/references/gate.md` for the tier table.

The orchestrator may run on any model the user has selected. These tiers apply to **subagents/workers** spawned from it. A standard orchestrator escalating one genuinely hard subtask to a heavier worker is the canonical cost-efficient pattern.

## Inline-First Principle

Every subagent spawn costs orchestrator messages. On subscription plans, this directly reduces how much work fits in a session. Before spawning a subagent, ask: **does this task need a separate agent, or can the orchestrator do it inline?**

Spawn a subagent when:
- Parallelism provides a clear wall-clock win (multiple independent investigation lanes)
- Isolation matters (reviewer should not see implementation context, cold read needs fresh eyes)
- The work is a **review** — never review your own work; always use a separate subagent for code and plan reviews

Do it inline when:
- The work is sequential anyway (classification, single-file investigation, planning a scoped fix)
- The orchestrator already has the relevant context loaded
- The task is bounded and the result is short (triage, RCA for a single failure mode)

When the complexity gate classifies work as MODERATE, default to inline for scoping, investigation, and planning, but still spawn a reviewer subagent. When STANDARD, use subagents per command-specific steps.

## Long-Running Workflow Pattern

When a workflow may process many units, inspect large logs, or run across multiple phases, the main thread should stay as a thin orchestrator rather than becoming the durable memory for every raw detail.

- **Main thread owns** ordering, dependency tracking, user decisions, checkpoint boundaries, and final synthesis.
- **Durable state lives in files**: use `PROJECT.md`, `PLAN.md`, or a command-specific local manifest when chat history would otherwise become the state store.
- **Subagents own bounded expensive context**: each receives only the unit, wave, or lane it needs plus the output contract.
- **Subagents return compact handoffs**: status, evidence summary, blockers, verification, residual risk, and next-action implications. Do not return full logs or diffs unless blocked.
- **The main thread updates durable state after every unit or wave** before starting the next one.
- **Checkpoint between waves/phases** when context or cost thresholds are near the limits in `rules/context-management.md`. Do not keep extending one long session just because context remains available.

Use command-specific manifests when the work has a natural table of units, for example large cherry-pick trains, multi-failure CI fixes, or batch PR reviews. Keep those files local-only unless the command explicitly says otherwise.

## Subagent Batch Rules

Use these rules whenever a command delegates implementation, investigation lanes, review batches, cherry-pick waves, or CI failure groups.

- Start with one unit unless the plan already proves independence.
- Batch 2-3 units only when ownership is disjoint and dependencies are clear.
- Use a single unit when work touches shared APIs, migrations, auth, routing, state models, generated artifacts, or cross-cutting contracts.
- Each subagent gets only the unit scope, relevant context excerpt, entrance criteria, exit criteria, expected validation, and handoff format.
- After each wave, collect compact handoffs, update durable state, run any required fan-in or review gate, then decide the next wave.
- Do not start the next wave while the current wave has failed acceptance, merge conflicts, unresolved review findings, or an open user decision.

## Subagent Context Loading

Subagents load their own domain rules — commands should not `@import` rules that only subagents use.

- **Main thread imports**: rules the main thread directly evaluates (complexity gate, input routing, orchestration, planning)
- **Subagent reads**: domain rules the subagent applies (code-review, testing, implementation, investigation, review-gate, stop-rules, shortcut-api)
- **Skill files reference rules by path**: e.g., "Read and apply `rules/review-gate.md`"
- **Commands tell subagents which files to read**: include the rule file path in the Agent tool prompt

Avoid redundantly loading the same rule in both contexts unless the main thread must evaluate a returned gate or handoff against that rule.
