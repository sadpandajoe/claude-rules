# /review-plan - One-Off Plan Review

@{{TOOLKIT_DIR}}/rules/stop-rules.md

> **When**: You have a `PLAN.md` or PROJECT.md-referenced plan and want a quality review without the full `/create-feature` workflow.
> **Produces**: Reviewed `PLAN.md`, all applicable reviewers at 8/10, cold read passed, and final scores in PROJECT.md.

## Usage

```
/review-plan
/review-plan --pm
```

`--pm`: Include PM brief review (`pm/references/review-feature-brief.md`) in addition to technical reviewers.

## Command Contract

The command owns one-off plan review only. It does not create the plan, implement it, or turn review comments into code changes.

- Read PROJECT.md to find the active plan pointer, then review `PLAN.md` as the formal plan body; do not preload unrelated workflow references.
- Use fresh reviewer subagents for each review pass after material plan revisions.
- Reuse a reviewer only to clarify that reviewer's own finding in the same pass.
- The main thread revises `PLAN.md`; PROJECT.md stores state/pointers and final scores. Subagents return scored findings only.
- Continue after material findings are resolved and the cold read says Go; otherwise stop on blocker, stop rule, or user decision.

## Steps

### 1. Read the Plan

Read PROJECT.md to find the active plan pointer, then read `PLAN.md` when present. If no `PLAN.md` exists, fall back to plan content embedded in PROJECT.md. Verify the plan contains at least one of:
- `Implementation Plan` or `Accepted Solution` section
- `Test Strategy` section
- `Feature Brief` section

If no plan content found, stop: `"No plan found in PROJECT.md. Write a plan first, then run /review-plan."`

### 2. Assess Plan Scope and Select Reviewers

Assess the plan's complexity to determine reviewer depth. Use the substance of the plan, not role labels, to choose reasoning effort per `rules/orchestration.md`.

| Plan scope | Reviewers | Cold read |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Moderate** — single subsystem, well-understood pattern, no architectural decisions | 1 reviewer: `plan-review/references/implementation.md` | `planning/references/finalize.md` |
| **Standard** — multi-system, real trade-offs, novel design, or ambiguous constraints | 3+ reviewers: `plan-review/references/architecture.md` + `plan-review/references/implementation.md` + `testing/references/review-testplan.md` | `planning/references/finalize.md` |

**Conditional reviewers** (add to Standard plans when applicable):
- `plan-review/references/frontend.md` — if plan touches frontend (React, CSS, UI components)
- `plan-review/references/backend.md` — if plan touches backend (API, database, migrations)
- `pm/references/review-feature-brief.md` — if `--pm` flag or plan has a `Feature Brief` section with scope/milestones

State the scope assessment, which reviewers are selected, and why before launching.

### 3. Review Iterations

Launch selected fresh reviewer subagents in parallel. Match reviewer reasoning effort to the actual plan complexity. Each reviewer:
- Reads only PROJECT.md plus the active plan content needed for its lens
- Loads its own skill file (subagents load their own domain rules)
- Produces a scored review block (X/10 with strengths, issues, suggestions)

After collecting scores:
- If all reviewers are at 8/10 or better → proceed to step 4
- If any reviewer is below 8/10 → revise `PLAN.md` based on their feedback, or PROJECT.md only when the plan is embedded there, then re-run fresh reviewers for material revisions. Reuse the same reviewer only to clarify their own finding in the same pass.
- Auto-iterate — do not ask the user whether to continue or which reviewers to re-run
- Only stop for a blocking decision that requires user input, or if stop rules trigger

### 4. Cold Read

Run `planning/references/finalize.md` as a fresh-eyes final check:
- If **Go** → proceed to step 5
- If **No-Go** with blocking issues → revise the plan and re-run finalize-plan
- If **No-Go** after two revisions → stop and surface the blocking issues to the user

### 5. Update PROJECT.md

Write final review scores to PROJECT.md:

```markdown
## Plan Review Scores
| Reviewer | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Architecture | X/10 |
| Implementation | X/10 |
| Test Plan | X/10 |
| [conditional reviewers] | X/10 |
| Cold Read | Go / No-Go |
```

### 6. Summary

```markdown
## Review-Plan Complete
[1-2 lines: plan quality assessment and whether it's ready for implementation]

### Review Scores
| Reviewer | Score |
|----------|-------|
| [reviewer] | [score] |

### Key Revisions
- [What changed based on review feedback — omit if no revisions needed]

### What to do next
- [Implement via /create-feature or start implementation directly]
```

## Non-Negotiable Gates

- [ ] All applicable reviewers at 8/10
- [ ] Cold read passed (Go)
- [ ] PROJECT.md updated with final scores
- [ ] Summary emitted

## PROJECT.md Update Discipline

- After review iterations complete: write final scores
- If revisions were made: update `PLAN.md`, or PROJECT.md only when the plan is embedded there

## Notes
- Standalone command — `/create-feature` step 4 does the same work inline, but this is for one-off use
- Does not create or implement the plan — only reviews an existing one
- Subagents load their own skill files; this command references skill paths but does not `@`-import them
