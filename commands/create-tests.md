# /create-tests - Create the First Meaningful Tests


> **When**: You want standalone test-only work for an area that does not yet have a meaningful suite, or `/update-tests` has handed off because there is nothing real to update.
> **Produces**: A first meaningful test suite or net-new high-signal coverage, validation results, and a summary of remaining gaps.

## Usage
```
/create-tests                         # First meaningful tests for current uncommitted work
/create-tests <file>                  # First meaningful tests for a specific file
/create-tests --function <name>       # First meaningful tests for a specific function
```

## Command Contract

- Only the main thread writes PROJECT.md. Subagents return compact handoffs.
- For STANDARD or expensive runs (large untested surface, multi-subsystem scope, repeated `/review-code` rounds), follow `rules/context-management.md`: write durable state to PROJECT.md at each phase boundary, then `/checkpoint --clear` before the next expensive phase.
- Required PROJECT.md updates on STANDARD/expensive runs:
  - After step 2 (initial tests written): `## Tests Created` (files added, behaviors covered, test layer chosen).
  - After step 3 (verify + review): `## Test Review Status` (verification strength, review rounds, Review Gate status).
- These writes are **hard gates before any `/checkpoint --clear`** on STANDARD/expensive runs.
- For STANDARD work, emit the Phase Plan block from `rules/complexity-gate.md` after classification.

## Steps

1. **Determine Scope**

   Identify the code to test:
   - Uncommitted changes: `git diff --name-only`
   - Specific file or function: as provided
   - Read the code thoroughly before writing any tests

2. **Create Initial Tests**

   Load [skills/testing/references/create-tests.md](../skills/testing/references/create-tests.md) for this step. This testing context owns:
   - running `review-tests` before writing tests
   - choosing the right test layer
   - creating the first meaningful tests for the target area
   - targeted verification

3. **Review Changed Test Files**

   Run `/verify` or equivalent targeted checks first, then run `/review-code` on the changed repo-tracked files as an internal loop.
   Keep iterating until only nitpicks remain or a real blocker/user decision appears.

4. **Summary**
   ```markdown
## Create-Tests Complete

   ### Outcome
   - [Created first meaningful suite / stopped on blocker]

   ### Scope
   - [What behavior or files were covered]

   ### Behavioral Coverage
   - [What regressions or behaviors are now covered]

   ### Review / Quality
   - [Review rounds and final review outcome]

   ### Verification
   - [Checks run]

   ### Risks / Blockers
   - [Anything still unverified or out of scope]

   ### Remaining Gaps
   - [Anything still not covered]

   ### Next Decision
   - [Ready for manual commit / needs more work]
   ```

## Notes
- `/create-tests` is a test-only command, not the normal entrypoint for feature or bug workflows
- Favor the smallest set of high-signal tests over broad test quantity
- `/review-code` is an internal phase here, not the expected next top-level user step
- Stop before committing unless the user explicitly requested commit/push behavior.
- TRIVIAL runs (one or two tests) skip the PROJECT.md hard gates; MODERATE runs update PROJECT.md once at the end; STANDARD/expensive runs follow the hard-gate cadence in the Command Contract.
