# /start - Initialize Session

@{{TOOLKIT_DIR}}/PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md

> **When**: Beginning any work session.
> **Produces**: Loaded PROJECT.md context and session entry.

This command is the only supported entrypoint for resuming work after `/clear`.
It restores workflow state from PROJECT.md rather than relying on chat memory.

## Steps

1. **Find PROJECT.md**

   Search these locations in order (stop at first match):
   1. Current working directory: `PROJECT.md`
   2. Git repo root: `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/PROJECT.md`
   3. Additional working directories from the environment

   The file may be a real file or a **symlink** — both are valid. Read it normally either way.

   - If found: Read completely
   - If not found anywhere: Ask if user wants to create one using `PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md`

2. **Check for Continuation Checkpoint**

   If PROJECT.md contains a `## Continuation Checkpoint` section:
   - Read the checkpoint state:
     - top-level command
     - phase
     - **active plan** (PLAN.md or none)
     - resume target
     - completed items
     - key workflow state
   - Add a session entry noting this is a continuation:
     ```markdown
     ### [Timestamp] - Session Resumed
     - Branch: [current branch]
     - Resuming from: [checkpoint timestamp]
     - Command: [top-level command from checkpoint]
     - Phase: [saved phase]
     - Active plan: [PLAN.md or none]
     - Resume target: [saved item or iteration]
     ```
   - **Defer loading PLAN.md.** Read PROJECT.md alone for orientation. Only load PLAN.md when the next phase actually requires it (entering review iterations or starting an implementation slice). This keeps context lean for resumes that are just status checks or fix-it work.
   - **Automatically resume the saved top-level command** from the checkpoint. Do not prompt the user.
   - The resumed command loads its own rules, skills, and supporting files on demand.
   - After the resume succeeds, clear or replace the stale checkpoint so the same state is not resumed twice unintentionally.

3. **Normal Session** (no checkpoint)

   Add session entry:
   ```markdown
   ### [Timestamp] - Session Start
   - Branch: [current branch]
   - Status: [summary from Current Status]
   - Goal: [ask user]
   ```

   ```
   "Session initialized. What would you like to work on?"
   ```

   Suggest relevant commands based on context:
   - New feature or planned refactor → `/create-feature`
   - Bug report, broken behavior, or RCA-first debugging → `/fix-bug`
   - Updating an existing test suite → `/update-tests`
   - Creating the first meaningful tests → `/create-tests`
   - Validating a story, PR, or environment without fixing it → `/run-test-plan`
   - Cherry-picking → `/cherry-pick`
   - Ready to open a PR → `/create-pr`
   - Capturing a pattern or reviewing memories → `/learn`
   - Completed phases cluttering PROJECT.md → `/archive-project-file`
   - Want to see all available commands → `/custom-skills-info`

4. **Recommend Archiving When Useful**

   Run these checks against PROJECT.md and the repo root:

   **Concrete signals** (high-confidence — surface the suggestion explicitly):
   - PROJECT.md contains one or more `Completed: <date> — <feature>` entries (workflow finished, content not yet archived)
   - A stale `PLAN.md` exists at the repo root with no Continuation Checkpoint pointing to it (workflow finished but the plan file still sits there)

   **Soft signals** (lower-confidence — mention only if a concrete signal already fired):
   - Long Development Log sections for work already complete
   - Resolved blockers still in active sections
   - Active work becoming hard to find

   If any **concrete signal** fires, surface the nudge prominently — before suggesting next commands — using this format:

   ```
   📦 Archive suggestion: [N] completed phase(s) detected, [stale PLAN.md present | no stale plan].
       Run /archive-project-file to clean up before the next major phase.
   ```

   If only soft signals fire, mention briefly at the end of the session entry.

   Always recommend, never auto-run. `/archive-project-file` is the only deletion path; workflows do not auto-delete.
